# Virtual Environments and Containers for Reproducible Research

## Outline:
1. Try installing software for the AEESP workshop through Anaconda
2. High-level overview of other tools for creating reproducible and custom computing environments
3. Discuss how these tools fit into reproducible research and open science
4. Discuss integration of these ideas into the Pinto lab

## AEESP Workshop Test
> > **"Getting the right tool to do things is hard and getting it installed on your system is a tough job sometimes."**

Goal at the workshop is to help learners overcome hurdles of getting started when analyzing data, including software installation. Want participants to walk away and be able to get sarted analyzing data without the unnecessary worry of installing tools.

Wanted a way to distribute software to the learners that has low-overhead for them and the organizers of the workshop, but also a system that allows learners to build off what we share and use long-term.

**Anaconda**: Anaconda is an open-source distribution of the Python and R programming languages for scientific computing, that aims to simplify package management and deployment. Package versions are managed by the package management system conda.

Anaconda creates a **Virtual Environment** - a named, isolated workspace - that makes it easy to separate different projects and avoid problems with different dependencies and version requirements. These environments can then be shared amongst other users to create **similar, but often not identical,** computing environments.

I created Anaconda environments to share with learners at the workshop that installs many common bioiformatic tools in microbial genomics and ecology (R packages, Anvio, QIIME), with only a few commands on their end.


**Warning:** This will take up ~7GB of space and take ~20 minutes. Can install onto an external device.
